<h1>What is this project?</h1>

  <h1>What is this app for?</h1>
      --
      <h2>I made this app to track job applications, what actions have been done for the application, and what are the results for each application. I found that a means of feedback for what application methods and actions work and don&apos;t work helps to motivate and inform the job search process and makes it feel less like a lottery.</h2>

      <h1>Ok, cool. I&apos;m interested. Now what?</h1>
