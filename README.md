# What is this project?

A job application website made with Next.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB and styled with Material-MUI, TailwindCSS, and Plotly.js. It can be accessed <a href="https://job-app-tracker-orpin.vercel.app">here</a>.

# What is this app for?
I made this app to track job applications, what actions have been done for the application, and what are the results for each application. I found that a means of feedback for what application methods and actions work and don&apos;t work helps to motivate and inform the job search process and makes it feel less like a lottery.


# Ok, cool. I&apos;m interested. Now what?
